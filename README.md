FINAL PROJECT: NYU-6463 PROCESSOR
NYU-6463 Processor Design

A 32-bit processor in VHDL which is capable of executing programs. 
The processor supports the instruction set as per design specification

Every instruction has 32 bits that define the type of instruction as well as the operands and the
destination of the result. 
The NYU-6463 Processor has three instruction types: 
(a) R-Type for arithmetic instructions, 
(b) I-Type for immediate value operations, load and store instructions
(c) J-Type for jump instructions.
